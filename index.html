        <p class="intro">PhD Student | Computer Science | Virginia Tech</p>
        <p class="about">Hi there! My name is Juno and I am a first-year PhD student in the <a href="https://reach.cs.vt.edu/" target="_blank">REACH Lab</a> at VT. My current research is on Computer Science Education in rural communities.
            I hope to understand how rural parents conceptualize computing education and STEM careers for their children. I strive to use asset-based, learner-centered, and participatory methodologies in my research.
            My goal is to make technology and society more equitable toward minoritized communities. I also hope to work with neurodivergent and disabled students to make CS more accessible as well as increase cognitive diversity in our field. </p>
