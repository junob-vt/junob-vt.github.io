                <h1>Juno Bartsch</h1>
                <p>Hi there! Iâ€™m Juno (they/them), a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at 
                    <a href="https://www.vt.edu/" target="_blank" aria-label="Link to Virginia Tech's website">Virginia Tech</a> and a 
                    <a href="https://eng.vt.edu/ceed/ceed-graduate-programs/new-horizon-graduate-scholars.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Link to New Horizons Scholars webpage">New Horizons Graduate Scholar</a>.
                    I am interested in researching with Autistic and ADHD students in Computer Science to better understand their strengths,
                    challenges, and needs to increase cognitive diversity in our field. 
                    My goal is to perform participatory, asset-based research that capitalizes on the wealth of knowledge and experiences that 
                    neurodivergent and disabled students bring to computer science. Ultimately, I aim to become a teaching-track professor
                    to support the equitable creation and instruction of technology as well as contribute to inclusion and accessibility in society more broadly.
                    Before starting at Virginia Tech, I received a B.S. with double majors in Computer Science and Education Studies from 
                    <a href="https://haverford.edu/" target="_blank" aria-label="Link to Haverford's website">Haverford College</a>.
                </p>
                <p>Outside of academics, I enjoy video games, painting, music, and baking. I also enjoy advocacy work and am the current Co-Chair of the

                    I am committed to supporting and working with fellow minoritized students in STEM, particularly neurodivergent, 
                    transgender/ gender-nonconforming, queer, first-gen, and low-income students. Feel free to reach out anytime via email!
